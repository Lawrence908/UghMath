### Implementation Plan:

#### 1. **Basic Integrals** (Definite and Indefinite)
   - Implement functionality to compute basic definite and indefinite integrals.
   - Display results step-by-step (e.g., applying the power rule, constant rule, etc.).
   - **Code Example**: Handle integrals like \( \int x^2 \, dx \) and \( \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx \).

#### 2. **Definite Integrals via Riemann Sums**
   - Allow the user to visualize Riemann sums as approximations of definite integrals.
   - Implement both left and right Riemann sums, and potentially the trapezoidal rule.
   - **Visualization**: Use `matplotlib` to show rectangles under the curve.

#### 3. **Evaluation Theorem and Net/Total Change**
   - Implement the Evaluation Theorem to compute definite integrals based on antiderivatives.
   - Show how integrals can represent net and total changes over time.
   - **Example**: A user could input velocity data and compute total distance traveled.

#### 4. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
   - Explain the connection between differentiation and integration through the Fundamental Theorem.
   - Allow users to input a function and see the integral and its derivative side-by-side.

#### 5. **Substitution Rule**
   - Implement substitution for integrals that require a change of variable.
   - Show users how to choose the substitution, apply it, and revert back to the original variable.
   - **Example**: \( \int 2x \sqrt{1+x^2} \, dx \).

#### 6. **Integration by Parts (IBP)**
   - Step-by-step breakdown of Integration by Parts.
   - Help users identify \( u \) and \( dv \) and work through each step of the process.
   - **Example**: \( \int x \sin(x) \, dx \).

#### 7. **Trigonometric Substitution Method**
   - Solve integrals involving trigonometric substitutions, like \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).
   - Visual aids could help show the geometry behind trig substitution.
   
#### 8. **Partial Fraction Decomposition (PFD)**
   - Decompose rational functions into simpler fractions for easier integration.
   - Guide the user through the decomposition and integration process.

#### 9. **Approximate Integration**
   - Implement methods for approximating integrals, including Simpson’s Rule and Trapezoidal Rule.
   - Allow users to input functions and see the error between approximations and exact integrals.

#### 10. **Improper Integrals**
   - Handle improper integrals that involve limits at infinity or discontinuities.
   - Show step-by-step how to approach these integrals and interpret divergent/convergent results.

#### 11. **Areas Between Curves**
   - Help users compute the area between two curves by setting up the integral and calculating it.
   - **Visualization**: Use `matplotlib` to display the region between curves graphically.

#### 12. **Volumes of Solids of Revolution**
   - Implement methods to compute volumes by rotation, including the disk/washer and shell methods.
   - Visual aids to show what these solids of revolution look like.

### Step-by-Step Feature:
At each step, you can display the integral in LaTeX format and explain the rule applied, guiding the user through the problem-solving process.

### Unit Circle:
Incorporating the unit circle into the project will involve:
- **Visualization**: Draw the unit circle and label key angles (e.g., 30°, 45°, 60°).
- **Flashcards**: Create a flashcard tool where users can test their knowledge of angle measures and corresponding coordinates.
