# UghMath: Turning My Math Struggles into Learning Opportunities

Math can be a challenge, but that’s exactly why I built **UghMath**. This tool helps break down tough integral problems, giving step-by-step explanations to make practicing calculus easier (and maybe a little less "ugh"). With features like LaTeX-formatted equations, unit circle visualizations, and interactive problem sets, UghMath turns learning into a more manageable, even enjoyable, process. Designed for students, by a student who would rather be doing just about anything else—but knows learning math is the way forward.

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Integral Solver**: Enter an integral, and UghMath will break it down step-by-step, applying integration rules like substitution or integration by parts.
- **LaTeX Formatted Output**: All integral solutions are displayed in LaTeX for clear, professional presentation.
- **Unit Circle Practice**: Generate and practice with visualizations of the unit circle to reinforce your trigonometry knowledge.
- **Interactive Problem Sets**: Solve randomly generated problems or input your own, with detailed solutions available.
